# EnthusiastHeadphones
A mod for Gorilla Tag which enhances the game's music experience.

## Instructions
### Headphones
With the mod installed, the Mute buttons used for music are replaced with a set of headphones. These headphones can be picked up and swapped between hands, similar to how holdables work in the base game.
### Listening
When holding a pair of headphones, the music connected to that pair will now be played on the headphones. If the pair is docked to the player's head, the music connected to that pair will play through the headset, and can even be brought to different maps.
### Limits
Headphones will return to their original position if they are brought too far away from it, this can be avoided by docking the headphones and then holding them in your hand.
### Display
Each pair of headphones has a display of information relating to the pair and the music connected to it:
- ``Track``: The current track which is being played
- ``Timer``: The remaining time until the music is ready to play
- ``Playing``: If the music is currently being played
- ``Muted``: If the music is currently muted and cannot be heard
- ``Version``: The current version of the mod
### Muting
When holding a pair of headphones, by pressing the Primary face button, the music connected to that pair will have it's muted state toggled on/off, which is also saved for future sessions.
